# Neovim Config

A lightweight, portable Neovim configuration built step by step for real work in
client environments.

This setup is intentionally a **work in progress**. The goal is not to become a
full IDE or a polished distribution. The goal is to keep a configuration that is
small enough to understand, easy to debug, and useful in restricted terminals.

## Principles

- Terminal-first workflow for R/Shiny, git, tests, shell tools, and Claude Code.
- No dependency on Nerd Fonts or GUI-only features.
- Minimal plugins, added only when they solve a clear problem.
- Modular Lua structure with each part easy to disable or replace.
- Stable plugin versions through `lazy-lock.json`.
- One change at a time, so the git history stays useful as documentation.

## R Setup Notes

The current language setup is deliberately R-first.

Expected external tools:

- R
- R package `languageserver`
- `air` available on `PATH`

Formatting is handled only by `air`. The R language server is used for editor
features and has document formatting disabled to avoid conflicts.

To disable automatic formatting for a project, create this file in the project
root:

```text
.disable_autoformat
```

Manual formatting through `<leader>bf` still uses the configured `air` LSP
client.

## Claude Code Notes

Claude Code is run through Neovim's built-in terminal, not through a plugin.

Expected external tool:

- `claude` available on `PATH`

`<leader>ac` opens Claude Code in a right-side window, starts it from the current
project root, and reuses the Claude terminal buffer when toggled again.
`<leader>as` sends either the current file path from normal mode or the selected
text from visual mode.

## Roadmap

The broader plan lives in `project.md`. The next likely steps are:

1. Keep tightening the current R workflow.
2. Add a file explorer such as Oil if the workflow needs it.
3. Add formatting support for one more language at a time.
4. Add Copilot only after the core editing workflow is solid.

## What This Config Avoids

- Ready-made Neovim distributions.
- Nerd Font assumptions.
- Plugin-heavy setup before the workflow needs it.
- Fancy UI at the cost of portability.
- Hiding complexity behind tools that are not understood yet.

## Guiding Rule

Build a tool for client work, not a pretty config.

It should always be possible to open the config, understand what is happening,
disable a piece, and keep working.
